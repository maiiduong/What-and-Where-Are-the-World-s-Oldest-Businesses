# What-and-Where-Are-the-World-s-Oldest-Businesses (Guided by DataCamp)
*In this project, I employ SQL to analyze three 200 observation datasets to identify the world's oldest businesses, their founded years, their locations, and their categories.*
## Questions to address:
1. Which and how many businesses were founded before 1000?
2. Which industry were they in?
3. What was the most common industry before 1000?
4. In which continent are the oldest businesses located?
## Key functions:
1. SELECT(), WHERE(), GROUP BY(), ORDER BY(), HAVING(), INNER JOIN()
2. Aggregate functions: COUNT(), MIN(), MAX()
## Dataset:
The data in this project is collected from [Business.Financing.co.uk](https://businessfinancing.co.uk/the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country/)
